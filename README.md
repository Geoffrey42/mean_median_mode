# mean_median_mode

Returns the mean, median and mode of a list of integers

## Assignment

Project assigment from Rust book chapter 8.

Given a list of integers, use a vector and return:

* The mean (the average value).
* The median (when sorted, the value in the middle position).
* The mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here).
